A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify images of **cats** and **dogs**.  
This project demonstrates image preprocessing, data augmentation, CNN training, and prediction.

---

## 📌 Features
- Preprocesses images using `ImageDataGenerator`.
- CNN architecture with convolution, pooling, and dense layers.
- Binary classification: **Cat (0) or Dog (1)**.
- Utility function to predict on custom images.
